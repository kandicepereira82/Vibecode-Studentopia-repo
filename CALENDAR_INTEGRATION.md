# Calendar Integration Guide

Studentopia automatically syncs your tasks to your device's calendar, making them available in Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, and any other calendar app on your device.

## 🚀 How Calendar Sync Works

Studentopia creates a labeled calendar on your device (like "Studentopia – Emma") that automatically syncs with all your calendar apps. Any tasks you add, update, or complete in Studentopia will automatically appear in your calendars.
