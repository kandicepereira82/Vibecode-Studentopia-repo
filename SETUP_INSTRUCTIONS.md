# Quick Setup Instructions

## Current Status

Your StudyPal app is running successfully with full multilingual support for 14 languages! However, you need to initialize your user profile to see all features.

## What You Need to Do

1. **Open the Profile Tab** - You should see it in the bottom navigation (rightmost tab with a person icon)

2. **Tap "Set Up Profile"** - You will see a blue button that says "Set Up Profile"

3. **Profile Created!** - This will create your profile with these default settings:
   - **Username**: Student
   - **Language**: English (UK) 🇬🇧
   - **Theme**: Nature (green tones)
   - **Study Pal**: Buddy the Cat 🐱
   - **Animations**: Enabled
   - **Notifications**: Enabled

4. **Explore All Tabs** - After tapping the button, all 9 tabs should now display content:
   - **Home**: Dashboard with progress tracking and Study Pal
   - **Tasks**: Add and manage your study tasks
   - **Calendar**: View tasks on a calendar
   - **Timer**: Pomodoro study timer
   - **Music**: Classical music player with 6 curated tracks
   - **AI Helper**: AI assistant for homework and grammar help
   - **Tips**: Study tips and motivational quotes
   - **Groups**: Study groups (future feature)
   - **Profile**: Customize your settings

## After Setup

Once your profile is created, you can:

1. **Change Language** - Go to Profile → Tap "Language" → Select from 14 languages:
   - 🇬🇧 English (UK)
   - 🇪🇸 Español
   - 🇫🇷 Français
   - 🇩🇪 Deutsch
   - 🇨🇳 简体中文
   - 🇯🇵 日本語
   - 🇸🇦 العربية
   - 🇰🇷 한국어
   - 🇧🇷 Português (BR)
   - 🇮🇳 हिन्दी
   - 🇮🇹 Italiano
   - 🇹🇷 Türkçe
   - 🇷🇺 Русский
   - 🇮🇩 Bahasa Indonesia

2. **Change Theme** - Go to Profile → Tap "Theme" → Choose from 10 colorful themes

3. **Customize Study Pal** - Go to Profile → Change your companion's name and choose from 20 animals

4. **Test All Features** - Try adding tasks, using the timer, playing music, and chatting with the AI assistant

## Why This Happened

The app was missing user data in local storage, which caused all screens except Profile to show blank. The "Set Up Profile" button is an emergency recovery feature that creates a new user profile with sensible defaults (English UK as the primary language).

## What's Working Now

- ✅ App compiling successfully
- ✅ All 14 languages integrated
- ✅ Profile setup button ready
- ✅ Music player functional
- ✅ All screens coded and ready to display
- ✅ No TypeScript or compilation errors

## Next Steps

Just tap that "Set Up Profile" button and you're good to go! If you have any issues after setup, let me know what you see.
